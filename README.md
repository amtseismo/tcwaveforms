Folder waveforms includes raw miniseeed files for Tahoma Creek Debris Flow

Includes deployed geophones (4K) stations and permanent stations (PERM) from the CC and UW networks.

Waveforms are from UTC 2023-08-15T23:00:00 to 2023-08-15T23:59:59.

To recreate plots, I recommend trimming from UTC 2023-08-15T23:20:00 to 2023-08-15T23:55:00. This should capture the whole signal from start to finish including the outburst and the debris flow.

Suspected outburst location is LAT 46.81693 and LON -121.81102.
